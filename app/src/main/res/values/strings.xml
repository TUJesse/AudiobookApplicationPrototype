    <string name="Princess_rose_and_the_golden_bird_p1">Many, many years ago, in a kingdom far, far away there lived a beautiful princess.
        She had long red hair and loved roses so much that everyone called her Princess Rose.
Every evening after dusk, Princess Rose went out on the balcony and clapped her hands. A golden bird came flying out of nowhere and alighted on her shoulder. Instantly,
        the princess’s hair began to shine, ablaze with brilliant red light. </string>

    <string name="Princess_rose_and_the_golden_bird_p2">When the bird started to warble an enchanting tune, Princess Rose joined it in a song, and everyone
        in the kingdom fell asleep and had sweet dreams till the break of dawn.
Thus passed the years. Every evening Princess Rose, along with the little golden bird, sang a loving lullaby,
        so that all people fell asleep and had sweet dreams till the break of dawn.
Until one day something terrible happened. A wicked witch learned about Princess Rose and decided to curse her.
“Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose’s color dim!” the witch said, and Princess Rose’s hair instantly turned as black as tar. </string>

    <string name="Princess_rose_and_the_golden_bird_p3">That evening, too, Princess Rose went out on her balcony and clapped her hands.
        But when the golden bird appeared, her hair glowed black instead of red. The bird warbled its enchanting melody, and Princess Rose sang her lullaby.
        Everyone in the kingdom fell asleep, but that night they only had bad dreams and nightmares.
On the following day, the saddened princess asked the bird:
“Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people’s dreams so sweet again till the break of dawn?”
“Black hair in rose water,” the bird chirped in reply.
The princess wondered at this counsel, but abided by it, nevertheless. She filled up a basin with water and sprinkled rose petals on its surface.
        Then, she dipped her hair into the rose water, and it instantly turned red again. </string>

    <string name="Princess_rose_and_the_golden_bird_p4">That evening, when the bird perched on her shoulder, the radiant red glow of her hair lit up the night sky once more.
        The princess sang her lullaby, and everyone in the kingdom fell asleep and had sweet dreams till the break of dawn.
The wicked witch was so very angry that her curse had been broken that she decided to cast it again.
“Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose’s color dim!”And the princess’s hair turned as black as tar again.
        Only this time the witch also picked up all of the rose blooms in the entire kingdom. “Let’s see how you’ll break my curse now!” she sneered, filled with rage. </string>

    <string name="Princess_rose_and_the_golden_bird_p5"> Once again, the saddened princess asked the bird:
    “Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people’s dreams so sweet again till the break of dawn?”
    “Black hair in rose water,” the bird chirped in reply.
    “But where should I find a rose?”
    “Black hair in rose water,” the bird chirped and flew away.
    The princess didn’t know what to do. So great was her anguish that her eyes filled with tears, one of them falling to the ground below.
    At that very moment, a young and handsome prince, who had stopped under the balcony of the princess, took out a little box and a single red hair from within it.
        He bent down and placed the hair atop the princess’s tear. And then, a miracle happened.
        Suddenly, the red hair turned into a red rose.
    The prince picked the rose and took it up to the princess.
Upon seeing the rose, she immediately brushed off her tears and plucked its petals to add to the water in the basin. Then, she dipped in her hair, and the curse was broken.
Everyone gasped in astonishment, and the King asked the prince:
“Young man, where did you find that red hair?”
“When the princess and I were both children, I picked a single strand of hair from her head as a sign of my loyalty to her. And she did the same to me, pulling out a strand of my own hair.”
“It’s true, father,” the princess confirmed and took out a little box. She opened it to reveal a single hair from the prince’s head inside.
Everyone was delighted with this news. The prince and Princess Rose got married on that very same day.
Upon learning that her curse had been broken again, the wicked witch’s evil nature swelled so much that she exploded into a thousand tiny pieces.
Eventually, rose blooms sprang up in every garden in the kingdom once again. And so it went:
        each evening Princess Rose sang her loving lullaby, so that all people fell asleep and had sweet dreams till the break of dawn.

    <string name="book5_p6"> once apon a time there was a princess</string>

    <string name="little_red_riding_hood_p1">
   Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she wouldn’t give to the child.
        Once she gave her a little riding hood of red velvet, which suited her so well that she never wore anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red Riding Hood.’
    One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.
        Set out before it gets hot, and as you go, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’
        ‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her promise.</string>

    <string name="little_red_riding_hood_p2">
        The grandmother lived in the wood, half a league from the village, but just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red Riding Hood didn’t know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.
        “‘Good day, Little Red Riding Hood!” said he, – ‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’ -‘Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?’ – ‘To my grandmother’s’ – ‘What have you got in your apron?’ – ‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day,
        so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger’ – ‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?’ – ‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must know it,’ replied Little Red Riding Hood.

    The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful – she will be better to eat than the old woman.
        I must act craftily, so as to catch both.’

    So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here – why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.’
        Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too.
        It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.’</string>

    <string name="little_red_riding_hood_p3"> Page 3,
         So she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.
    Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked at the door. – ‘Who is there?´- ‘Little Red Riding Hood,’ replied the wolf  “She is bringing cake and wine; open the door” –
         ‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot get up.’
    The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.

    Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.
         She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.’
         She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.

    ‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’ – ‘All the better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply’ – “But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said –
         ‘All the better to see you with, my dear” – ‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’ – ‘All the better to hug you with’ – ‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’ –
         ‘All the better to eat you with!’ And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red Riding Hood.</string>

    <string name="little_red_riding_hood_p4"> When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.’
         So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it.
    ‘Do I find you here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ But just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.

    When he had made two snips, he saw the little red riding hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf.’
         After that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.

    Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived.
         But Red Riding Hood thought to herself: ‘As long as I live, I will never leave the path by myself to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’</string>

    <string name="Cinderella_p1">Part 1
        Once, there lived a sweet tempered girl whose name was Cinderella. Unfortunately, her mother died young, and her father married again.
        His second wife had a sharp temper and her two daughters were just like her. In a word - horrid.
        The horrid sisters loved to boss Cinderella. The first said:
        “Cinders! It’s your job to clean the fireplace. That’s why you’re called Cinders! Get it?”
        And before she had finished sweeping the grate, the second sister said,
    </string>

    <string name="Cinderella_p2">Part 2
        “Cinders! Don’t dawdle. Light up the fire and make me a hot bath with sweet smelling candles!”
        And as she was heating the bath, the horrid mother said, “Cinders! Why haven’t you been to the market yet?”
        All day long, Cinderella swept, and scrubbed, and fetched and carried.
        In winter, the young ladies were invited to the Royal Ball.
        For a whole month they tried on taffeta ball gowns, frilly petticoats, and strappy shoes.
    </string>

    <string name="Cinderella_p3">Part 3
        It was Cinderella, of course, who helped them in and out of their rich costumes, and who pressed and folded everything.
        Her own clothes were practically rags. The big night came and poor Cinderella was left at home, sitting alone by the fireplace.
        A mouse came up to her and said, “Dear, dear, don’t fret. A good fairy is outside, and she says that you shall go to the ball.”
        Cinderella ran out to the courtyard where the good fairy told the young girl:
        “Be sure to leave the ball before the clock strikes midnight, or you will be more embarrassed than you ever have been in your life!”
    </string>

    <string name="Cinderella_p4">Part 4
        A golden coach took her to the palace, and on the way she changed into a beautiful gown.
        When she entered the ballroom, all eyes were upon her, including those of her sisters who did not recognise her.
        The prince asked the new arrival to dance, not once, but again and again. Before the evening was out, he had fallen in love with the mysterious young beauty.
        He was about to ask for her hand in marriage when the clock began to strike twelve.
        “Oh! You must excuse me!” exclaimed Cinderella and she ran for the door.
  </string>

    <string name="Cinderella_p5">Part 5
        As she dashed down the steps, one of her dancing slippers fell from her foot and she had to hop to the coach.
        In the morning, the Prince found the lost slipper and ordered his servants to take it up and down the land until they discovered the foot that exactly fitted it.
        When the Prince’s servants came to the house where Cinderella lived, her horrid sisters were eager to try on the slipper.
        “It fits me perfectly,” said the first, but she could not shove her heal inside.
        “You can call me, ‘Your Royal Highness’ because my foot fits better,” said the second.

    </string>

    <string name="Cinderella_p6">Part 6
        But it was clear that her foot was even less able to slip into the slipper.
        The royal servant looked up and saw Cinderella sitting by the fireplace that she had been cleaning.
        There was a bit of soot on her nose, and it made her face all the more charming. He said: “Would you care to try on the shoe, miss?”
        “Why bother with her? She’s just the maid,” said the horrid sisters’ mother.
        “I would like to try, thank you,” said Cinderella. Her foot slipped in perfectly.
    </string>


    <string name="Cinderella_p7">Part 7
        “Who would have thought it? Our quest is complete,” declared the royal servant.
        “What?” exclaimed the mother. “You’ve got to be kidding!”
        “You idiot, you’ve got the wrong girl,” protested the horrid sisters.
        But the servant was already calling for the coachman to take Cinderella to the palace, dressed in her rags,
        exactly as she was, and wearing her normal shoe on one foot, and her dancing slipper on the other.
        </string>


    <string name="Cinderella_p8">Part 8
        As Cinderella left the house, the mother of the horrid girls cried out,
        “Good riddance! We’ve had enough of your cheek!”
        But Cinderella knew that she had found true love, and the very next day, she and the prince were wed,
        and the bells rang out all over the land.

    <string name="Goldilocks_p1">Part 1
        Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own in a wood.
        One of them was a little, small wee bear; one was a middle-sized bear, and the other was a great, huge bear.
        One day, after they had made porridge for their breakfast, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling.
        And while they were walking, a little girl came into the house. This little girl had golden curls that tumbled down her back to her waist, and everyone called her by Goldilocks.
        Goldilocks went inside. First she tasted the porridge of the great, huge bear, and that was far too hot for her.
    </string>

    <string name="Goldilocks_p2">Part 2
        And then she tasted the porridge of the middle bear, and that was too cold for her.
        And then she went to the porridge of the little, small wee bear, and tasted that.
        And that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so well, that she ate it all up.
        Then Goldilocks went upstairs into the bed chamber and first she lay down upon the bed of the great,
        huge bear, and then she lay down upon the bed of the middle bear and finally she lay down upon the bed of the little, small wee bear, and that was just right.
    </string>


    <string name="Goldilocks_p3">Part 3
        So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there until she fell fast asleep.
        By this time, the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough, so they came home to breakfast.
        “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!” said the great huge bear, in his great huge voice.
        “Somebody has been at my porridge!” said the middle bear, in his middle voice.
        Then the little, small wee bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge pot, but the porridge was all gone.
 </string>

    <string name="Goldilocks_p4">Part 4
            “Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!” said the little, small wee bear, in his little, small wee voice.
            Then the three bears went upstairs into their bedroom.
            “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!” said the great, huge bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.
            “Somebody has been lying in my bed!” said the middle bear, in his middle voice.
            And when the little, small, wee bear came to look at his bed, upon the pillow there was a pool of golden curls,
    </string>


    <string name="Goldilocks_p5">Part 5
        and the angelic face of a little girl snoring away, fast asleep.
        “Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!” Said the little, small wee bear, in his little, small wee voice.
        Goldilocks jumped off the bed and ran downstairs, out of the door and down the garden path.
        She ran and she ran until she reached the house of her grandmama.
        When she told her grandmama about the house of the three bears who lived in the wood, her granny said:
        “My my, what a wild imagination you have, child!”
